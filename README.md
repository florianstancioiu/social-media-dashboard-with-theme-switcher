## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS nesting
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- CSS borders don't support linear gradients

### Continued development

- I would like to convert the project to vanilla web components, so that I can learn them thoroughly
